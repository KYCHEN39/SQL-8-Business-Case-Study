<h1 align="center">SQL 8 Business Case Studies</h1>

## Overview
I tackled some fantastic case studies curated by Danny Ma. The case studies give you hands-on experience to clean data and understand the challenges of working with real-world data. They test your SQL level from Basic to Advanced concepts such as **window functions, common table expressions, ranking functions, case stataments, etc.**.
